This project was created using React Js, MySQL, and Node Js.
For the library I'm using Ant Design for the layout, structure, and styling, E-charts for visualizing data, and Bootstrap for additional styling.

On the left of the page, there is a sidebar to display some menus on this website, there are Home/Dashboard and My Playlist.
Let's move on to the content side of things. There are some Card components at the top of the screen that feature popular genres including R&B, Pop, K-Pop, and Hip Hop. Each card shows the number of popularity artists, their names, and the names of their songs.
